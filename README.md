# InfinitySolve-Gesture-Based-AI-Calculator
InfinitySolve is an innovative, AI-driven calculator that uses hand gestures for solving mathematical problems. By integrating computer vision, real-time gesture recognition, and AI, InfinitySolve makes math problem-solving accessible, engaging, and hands-free.

# Features
**Gesture-Based Input:** Perform math operations with intuitive hand gestures captured by a webcam.

**Real-Time Processing:** Uses the Gemini API for instant and accurate equation solving.

**Image Upload:** Upload images of math problems for interpretation and solution.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Includes features like dark mode and real-time feedback to enhance user experience.

**Accessibility:** Designed for users with limited mobility to provide a hands-free experience.


# Project Overview

InfinitySolve combines cutting-edge computer vision and AI to transform how users solve math problems. It caters to students, educators, and professionals needing efficient, accessible solutions.


# **Prerequisites**

Python 3.x

Django

OpenCV

CVZone

Gemini API access


# How to Use

**Draw Gestures:** Use a webcam to draw equations in the air with single-finger gestures. Use two fingers to pause and an open hand to clear.

**Upload Images:** Alternatively, upload a picture of a math problem, and InfinitySolve will process and solve it.

**Receive Feedback:** The app provides real-time feedback on recognized gestures, making it intuitive and easy to use.


# Example Use Cases

**Students:** Interactive, hands-free learning for solving complex equations.

**Educators:** Demonstrate math concepts dynamically in classrooms.

**Accessibility-Focused Users:** Ideal for individuals with physical limitations who benefit from hands-free technology.


# **Challenges and Limitations**


**Lighting Conditions:** Gesture recognition accuracy may drop in low-light environments.

**Device Compatibility:** Performance varies across different webcams and platforms.

**API Dependency:** Reliance on Gemini API for complex equations introduces external dependencies.


#**Future Enhancements**


**Advanced Math Features:** Support for more complex operations like integrals and graph plotting.

**Voice Command Integration:** Adding voice controls for even greater accessibility.

**Machine Learning Integration:** Enhanced gesture tracking using ML models for improved accuracy.
